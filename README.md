# ðŸŽ¯ Subsify

AI-powered customer subscription prediction platform with advanced machine learning models.

## Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly form for entering customer data
- **Model Selection**: Choose between Naive Bayes and Neural Network algorithms
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant subscription probability calculations with confidence scores
- **Customer Insights**: Actionable recommendations based on customer behavior patterns
- **Model Transparency**: Clear explanation of prediction factors and algorithm differences
- **Professional Branding**: Clean, modern interface designed for business users

## Model Details

- **Primary Algorithm**: Gaussian Naive Bayes (fast, interpretable)
- **Secondary Algorithm**: Neural Network (complex patterns, higher accuracy potential)
- **Web App**: Both models available with real-time switching
- **Features**: 9 customer attributes (usage patterns, behavior metrics, demographics)
- **Training Data**: 1000 synthetic customer records with identical train/test splits
- **Performance**: Both models optimized for subscription prediction accuracy
- **Validation**: Stratified 80/20 split with consistent random state (42) for reproducibility
